# Automated Provisioning With Ansible

This project involves Ansible created on our jenkins server to configure our web servers, db servers and nginx load balancing server. Also the ansible server which is the same server as the jenkins server here is used as a jump host / bastion to restrict direct SSH access into web servers.
